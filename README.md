# Chatting app backend

This is a simple chatting app to send & receive messages. Built with the MERN stack.
The [frontend](https://github.com/KhaledMAlasmari/ChattingAppFrontend) and the backend [backend](https://github.com/KhaledMAlasmari/ChattingAppBackend) are on separate repos.

The project is incomplete. I don't really know if I'm gonna continue working on it but if I ever did I'll probably rewrite a bunch of stuff...

## Installation 
env variables:
```
PORT=port
MONGODB_URI=url
TEST_MONGODB_URI=url
JWTSECRET=hehexdrofllol
```

## Thoughts
Working on backend was... fine(?) I didn't really like the repetitiveness of it but it was bearable unlike the frontend
